# bj-term
 Python Blackjack in the Terminal
 
 A "collaborative experiment" using GPT4 as my development partner.

## Usage ##
- Ensure python is isntalled
- Install python art module `pip install art` or `pip3 install art`
- In whatever directory you place the file, from your terminal, run the commmand `python3 bj-term.py`
- Depending on your configuration, alternatively you can try running it as `python bj-term.py`
- That's it!
