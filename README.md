## Game Rules

The game follows the standard rules of Blackjack:

- The player's goal is to get closer to 21 points than the dealer without going over 21
- Numbered cards are worth their face value, face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) are worth 10, and Aces are worth 1 or 11
- The player starts with two cards and can choose to "hit" to receive additional cards or "stand" to keep their current hand
- The dealer also starts with two cards, but only one card is visible to the player until the end of the game
- If the player's hand exceeds 21 points, they "bust" and lose the game
- If the dealer's hand exceeds 21 points, they "bust" and the player wins the game
- If neither player busts, the one with the highest hand value below 22 wins the game
